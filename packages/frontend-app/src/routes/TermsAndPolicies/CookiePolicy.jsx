            similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites,

            any successor URLs, mobile or localized versions and related domains
            / sub-domains ("Websites") and/or our mobile application ("App") and

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
                mobile device when you visit a website, mobile app or use an
                online platform. Cookies are widely used by online service
                providers to facilitate and help to make the interaction between
                users and websites, mobile apps and online platforms faster and
                easier, as well as to provide reporting information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies set by the website and/or mobile app and/or platform
                owner (in this case, Intercom) are called "first party cookies".
                Cookies set by parties other than the website and/or mobile app
                and/or platform owner are called "third party cookies". Third
                party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
                provided on or through the website and/or mobile app and/or
                platform (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and
                analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can
                recognise your computer or device both when it visits the
                website and/or mobile app and/or platform in question and also
                when it visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps and/or
                platforms.

            <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons.
                Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
                Websites and/or App and/or platform to operate, and we refer to
                these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
                cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
                users to enhance the experience on our Websites and/or App
                and/or platform. Third parties serve cookies through our
                Websites and/or App and/or platform for analytics and other
                purposes. This is described in more detail below.

                Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a

                similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
                (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are
                tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable
                us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites and/or App
                and/or platform. In many instances, these technologies are
                reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining
